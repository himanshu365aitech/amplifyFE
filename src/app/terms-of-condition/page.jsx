                eliminate the amount of any withholding or deduction for taxes
                in respect of payments made under this Agreement. You agree that
                all payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid
                are non-refundable during the Initial Subscription Term or then
                current Renewal Term, as applicable. Amplify Research may change
                prices for the Services from time to time, in its sole
                discretion. Any price changes will be effective upon the
                commencement of Your next Renewal Term; provided, that Amplify
                Research shall provide You with reasonable notice of any such
                fee increase prior to the expiration of the Initial Subscription
                Term or any Renewal Term. Prices specified in the Order Form may
                include discounts or promotional pricing. These discounts or
                promotional pricing amounts may be temporary and may expire upon
                the commencement of a Renewal Term, without additional notice.
                Amplify Research reserves the right to discontinue or modify any
                promotion, sale or special offer at its sole and reasonable
                discretion. You agree that in the event Amplify Research is
                unable to collect the fees owed to Amplify Research for the
                Services through Your Account, Amplify Research may take any
                other steps it deems necessary to collect such fees from You and
                that You will be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred
                by Amplify Research in connection with such collection activity,
                including collection fees, court costs and attorneys’ fees. You
                further agree that Amplify Research may collect interest at the
                lesser of 1.5% per month or the highest amount permitted by law
                on any amounts not paid when due.

                Unless stated otherwise, all prices and fees shown by Amplify

                and regulatory fees will be charged on the invoices issued by
                Amplify Research in accordance with local laws and regulations.
                Amplify Research, in its sole discretion, will calculate the

                exemption documentation is not valid, Amplify Research reserves
                the right to charge applicable taxes to You.

                Payment of Taxes and Fees. You will pay to Amplify Research any

                Research’s provision of the Services to You. If You are required

                reduction or offset in amounts payable to Amplify Research
                hereunder and You will pay and bear such additional amount, as

                VAT due by the customer. In the event Taxes and Fees are due
                towards the taxing authorities by You instead of Amplify

                You will provide Amplify Research with all appropriate evidence
                for Amplify Research to demonstrate Your business nature, such

                location where the Customer has established its business based
                on the Customer Data, or for individuals where that individual
