          <span className="font-medium">Limited Information from Zoom Email and Calendar Services:</span> “Zoom
            Email” refers to Zoom’s native email service and emails sent from
            Zoom’s native email service. Zoom Email is designed to be end-to-end
            encrypted by Zoom by default for emails sent and received directly
            between active Zoom Email users. Support for end-to-end encryption
            requires Zoom Email users to have added a device to their Zoom Email
            account with the associated email address and to use a supported
            Zoom client. When an email is end-to-end encrypted, only the users,
            and, depending on their settings, account owners, or designated
            account administrators control the encryption key and therefore
            access to the email content, including body text, subject line,
            attachments and custom labels applied to messages by users in their
            inboxes. Emails sent to or received from non-Zoom Email users are
            encrypted after the email is sent or received from Zoom’s servers,
            if the Zoom Email user chooses to send them with encryption. In all
            cases, Zoom does have access to email metadata used for basic email
            delivery—specifically, email addresses in the from, to, cc, and bcc
            fields, time, mimeID, and the number and size of attachments. From
            use of Zoom’s native calendar service, Zoom receives information
            regarding meeting invitations, body text, sender and recipients, and
            other calendar information.
          </li>
          <li>
          <span className="font-medium">Content from Third-Party Integrations:</span> Users can access email and
            calendars from third-party services through their Zoom client, if
            they choose to integrate them. This information is not end-to-end
            encrypted by Zoom, but Zoom employees do not access this content,
            unless directed to, or required for legal, safety, or security
            reasons. If account owners and/or their users integrate their
            third-party emails with products and services offered or powered by
            Zoom, such as business analytics tools like Zoom IQ, Zoom may
            collect or process email information, including email content,
            headers and metadata, from such third-party services in order to
            provide services requested by the account and to improve the
            product.{" "}

            owner’s company size or industry, contact information, or activity
            of certain enterprise domains. Zoom may also obtain information from
            third-party advertising partners who deliver ads displayed on Zoom
            products and services, such as whether you clicked on an ad they
            showed you.
